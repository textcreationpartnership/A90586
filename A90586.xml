         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Right Honorable, the Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes in Parliament aſſembled, <hi>The humble Petition of the Committee for the County of</hi> Kent,</head>
            <opener>Sheweth,</opener>
            <p>THat Your Peritioners doe with all humility and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe bleſſe God for the preſent fruits of your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied labours, in the great worke of Reformation: particularly, in the removeall of many and great obſtacles, and hindrances thereof: And for the preſent pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of your pious intentions, and care for the ſending abroad of an able, pious, and painfull Miniſtery, upon the well ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement whereof, udner God, doth reſt the ſtability and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of that great and weighty worke.</p>
            <p>The ſerious thoughts hereof give occaſion to your Petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to bewaile the ſad condition of this County, in reſpect of the uncertain, floting and miſerable condition of our Miniſtery, occaſioned by the very nature, manner, and adjuncts of their ſubſiſtence by way of Tythes, which the experience of thus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ages doth plainly evince to be miſerably attended with theſe enſuing miſchiefes, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That for the nature of this ſubſiſtence, It is a very miſtery and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:153478:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 54 -->and ſecret, not eaſily without much art, and induſtry attained unto: Namely for the Miniſter to know his dues, demandable, or the Pariſhioners their duties payable; whence ariſeth, that multitude of ſcandalous and vexatious ſuites, and brabbles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Miniſter and People, which doth fill almoſt all the Courts at Weſtminſter, and of late the Juſtice-ſittings in the Country likewiſe with cauſes of this kind.</p>
            <p>For the manner of it, reſpecting either the collecting or pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, it is a mutuall ſcourge in the hand of Miniſter and People each to other; If either or both (as too often happens) be covetous or croſſe.</p>
            <p>For its adjuncts, the miſchiefs of them will appeare innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, if the pregnancy of onely one be but conſidered, namely the unreaſonable diſproportion of Livings, or values of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to which they are belonging, whence ariſe theſe inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble evils;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That moſt unworthy perſons, who by favour or friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or any ſiniſter waies can get into the greateſt Livings, being once inveſted with a legall right of free-hold for their lives, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely fleece the flocke, and feed themſelves, without feare or care, more then to keepe themſelves without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of a ſequeſtration, whileſt others both painfull and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable ſerve and ſterve.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That for obtaining of thoſe Livings, we ſee ſuch ſordid compliances with ſuch perſons as have the fatteſt benefices (as they count and call them) in their diſpoſe, ſuch artifices in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving, making and colouring over Symoniacall and ſinfull bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaines, compacts and matches, ſuch chopping of Churches, and reſtleſſe change of places, till they get into the eaſieſt and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt, and other ſuch like practiſes, not to be named, nor yet to be prevented, or removed, otherwiſe then by plucking up the very root which naturally brancheth out it ſelfe into theſe foreſaid miſchiefes, ſo obſtructive and deſtructive to all Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
            <p>All which conſidered, your Petitioners out of their unfained deſires of the happy progreſſe of this great worke of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereof without a godly and well ſetled Miniſtery wee can have no hopes, doe humbly ſubmit to the conſideration
